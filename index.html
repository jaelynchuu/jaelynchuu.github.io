        <p class="lead mb-4">A driven and hardworking person who strives for success. While looking for excellence, I pay attention to detail. While my work reflects my thoroughness and precision, there is always room for improvement and helpful criticism. I am open to criticism in order to help my own improvement. When given tasks, I do not procrastinate and do each task to the best of my abilities. I will put occupation and its duties as a main priority in my life. I am a very organized person, I know where everything is and I put things I’m not using anymore away right away. It’s not hard for me to collaborate with others. I love hearing ideas from other people and inputting my own ideas as well. I’m not scared to take initiative in projects and start the conversation about what should be done.<br><br>

        I have worked at Panera Bread for about 11 months where I have used and acquired many skills. I have done many tasks including cashier, dining, and dishwashing. The role of cashier has taught me the importance of good customer service and the benefits that come with it. I have enhanced my multitasking skills by being a barista at the same time I am being a cashier. In this environment, I was able to put my communication skills to the test. Being on dining duty has taught me the importance of sanitation and cleanliness in the cafe. I frequently wiped down tables and put away dishes. As a dishwasher, I learned how to be organized in where I put things so other employees can use them. It also has taught me the ability to understand and meet the cafe’s standards for health and safety. Being in high school, having a job taught me time management and having balance in my life. The experience I have gained from Panera Bread has taught me many skills which I can use in other professional environments.<br><br>

        The skills I have gained from my own experiences and working at Panera have allowed me to succeed in other areas of my life. I’m open with my thoughts and constantly accept others’ opinions. Although I can get very stressed, I will keep trying until I get it right. I have done multiple volunteering opportunities along with being a private caregiver. These jobs have given me experience outside of the food industry and allowed me to expand my skills and experience. My current skills aren’t limited and I believe that I can gain more through more experiences and opportunities. It expanded my adaptability in different environments and allowed me to find what I’m interested in pursuing.
